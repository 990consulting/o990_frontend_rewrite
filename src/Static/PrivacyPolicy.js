                  <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information ("Personal
                    Information")
                    that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we
                    don’t
                    own or control, or people that we don’t manage.&nbsp; We gather various types of Personal Information
                    from
                    our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in
                    connection
                    with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up
                    a
                    user account and profile, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your
                    requests
                    for
                    certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also
                    share
                    some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>
                  <p>As noted in the <a href={termsOfService}>Terms of Service</a>, we do not
                    knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under

                    please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to
                    us.
                    If
                    we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that
                    information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal
                    information, please contact us at <a href={mail}>info@open990.com</a>.</p>

                  <p>We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from

                    time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on <a

                    after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the

                  <p>We may communicate with you if you’ve provided us the means to do so. For example, if you’ve given us

                    to
                    recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are
                    visited
                    and
                    by how many people.&nbsp; You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to

                  <p>If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies
                    to
                    you.&nbsp; Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we
                    aren’t
                    responsible for their privacy policies and practices.&nbsp; Please be aware that cookies placed by
                    third
                    parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those

                    parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>

                    users use a particular feature of the Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services

                    this

                    do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different
                    websites.&nbsp; Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time, which means that we

                    and
                    in
                    what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online
